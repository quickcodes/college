# R

## Defination
R is a software environment which is used to analyze statistical information and graphical representation. R allows us to do modular programming using functions.

## Features of R Programming language
- R is a domain-specific programming language which aims to do data analysis. It has some unique features which make it very powerful. The most important arguable being the notation of vectors. The vectors allow us to perform a complex operation on a set of values in a single command. There are the following features of R programming:
- It is a simple and effective programming language which has been well developed.
- It is data analysis software.
- It has the concepts of user-defined, looping, conditional, and various I/O facilities.
- It has a consistent and incoporated set of tools which are used for data analysis.
- For different types of calculation on arrays, lists and vectors, R contains a suite of operators.
- It provides effective data handling and storage facility.
- It is an open-source, powerful, and highly extensible software.
- It provides highly etensible graphical techniques.
- It allows us to perform multiple calculations using vectors.
- R is an interpreted language.
