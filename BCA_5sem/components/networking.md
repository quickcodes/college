# Networking

If you are in the Technical world then Networking is something I highly suggest you to understand it deeply. The more you learn about computer networks the more beneficial it is. It gives you a core understanding of what is actually happening.

Understanding Computer Networks is really fun. You may hear of cloud computers, cloud applications, cloud bla bla bla etc. So what does cloud mean? Are they the actual clouds? Definitely not in Technology cloud simply means internet so what cloud computing means is a computer on the internet. It's a basic thing that many of advance tech guys don't know.

Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other.

So in order to communicate our computer with another computer, there are two ways.

1. Physical
2. Logical

#### Physical
By physical communication what I mean is connecting computers with physical stuff like cables. So they can transfer data or things like that. And because devices are connected physically the speed of communication is much faster than logical. And here device can be anything like a camera, keyboard, mouse, display, anything... networking is not only communication between two computers. The keyboard and CPU also need to communicate, and so on.

#### Logical
A logical network communication got done wirelessly and here devices are called nodes. There are two types of models by which we can logically communicate.
1. OSI Model
2. tcp/ip model
