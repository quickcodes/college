It uses single voltage level to represent data in this scheme to represent binary 1 high voltage is transmit & to represent 0 no voltage is transmitted.
	It is also called unipolar non return to 0 because there is no rest condition that is either represents 1 or 0.

Polar encoding: Polar encoding scheme uses multiple voltage level to represent binary values.
Types of polar encoding -
1. Non return to 0 NRZ - It uses 2 different voltage level to represent binary values generally positive voltage represent 1 and negative value represent 0. It is also NRZ because there is no rest condition.
NRZ scheme has 2 varients :
	a) NRZ-L  It changes voltage level when a different bit is incountered.
	b) NRZ-I
2.
