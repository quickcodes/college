## Introduction and basic concepts of -
## Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is a digital cellular technology that uses spread spectrum techniques to allow multiple users to share the same frequency band simultaneously. In CDMA, each user is assigned a unique code that is used to spread the user's signal over the entire frequency band. Because each user is assigned a unique code, the receiver is able to separate the signals of different users by "de-spreading" each signal using the corresponding code. This makes CDMA a form of multiplexing, which allows multiple users to share the same frequency band without interfering with each other. CDMA is used in many cellular networks around the world, including 3G and 4G networks. It is also used in other types of communication systems, such as satellite and military communications.

## Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a digital cellular technology that is widely used for mobile communication around the world. It is the most widely used mobile communication technology in the world, with over 5 billion users. GSM is a circuit-switched system, which means that a dedicated connection is established between two phones for the duration of a call. GSM uses Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) to allow multiple users to share the same frequency band by dividing each frequency into time slots. Each user is assigned a specific time slot in which to transmit and receive data. GSM also uses a system of cell towers to manage communication between phones. When a phone is turned on, it registers with the nearest cell tower, which allows it to communicate with other phones on the network. GSM is used in many countries around the world and is the basis for 3G and 4G mobile communication technologies.

## Wireless Local Loop (WLL)
Wireless Local Loop (WLL) is a telecommunications system that uses wireless technology to provide the "last mile" connection between the telephone exchange and the customer's premises. The term "last mile" refers to the connection between the telephone exchange and the customer's premises, which is often the most difficult and expensive part of the telecommunications infrastructure to build and maintain. WLL systems are used to provide telephone, internet, and other communication services to areas where it is not practical or cost-effective to lay traditional copper or fiber optic cables.

In a WLL system, the telephone exchange is connected to a network of base stations, which are equipped with antennas that transmit and receive signals over a wireless link. Customers' premises are equipped with customer premises equipment (CPE), which consists of a wireless transceiver and a telephone interface. The CPE communicates with the base station over the wireless link, providing the customer with access to the telephone exchange and other communication services. WLL systems are often used in rural areas, remote locations, and developing countries where it is difficult to lay traditional cables.

## Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a technology that allows you to make telephone calls over the internet. Instead of using a traditional telephone network, VoIP converts your voice into a digital signal that travels over the internet. This allows you to make calls from a computer, phone, or other device with an internet connection.

VoIP has many advantages over traditional telephone service. It is often much cheaper than traditional phone service, especially for long-distance and international calls. It is also more flexible, as you can make and receive calls from any device with an internet connection, and you can use the same phone number no matter where you are. VoIP also offers many advanced features, such as voicemail, call forwarding, and conference calling.

VoIP has become increasingly popular in recent years, and it is now used by businesses and individuals around the world. It is especially useful for people who need to make a lot of long-distance or international calls, or for those who need to be able to make and receive calls from multiple devices.

## Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows devices to communicate with each other over short distances. It is a popular method of wireless communication, especially for devices that are not always connected to the internet, such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops.

Bluetooth uses a radio frequency to transmit data between devices. When two Bluetooth devices are in range of each other, they can establish a connection and exchange data. This allows you to connect your phone to a Bluetooth speaker or headset, for example, or to transfer files between two computers.

Bluetooth is a low-power technology, which means that it consumes very little energy and can be used for long periods of time without draining the battery of your device. It is also relatively inexpensive, which makes it a popular choice for many types of devices. Bluetooth is used in a wide range of products, including phones, tablets, laptops, speakers, headphones, and many other types of devices.

## Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet and to each other without the need for cables. It is based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, which defines a set of protocols for wireless local area networks (WLANs).

Wi-Fi uses radio frequencies to transmit data between devices. When a device, such as a laptop or smartphone, is connected to a Wi-Fi network, it can communicate with the internet and with other devices on the network. This allows you to connect to the internet wirelessly, and to share data and resources with other devices on the network.

Wi-Fi is widely used in homes, offices, and public places, such as coffee shops and libraries, to provide internet access. It is also used in many types of devices, including phones, tablets, laptops, and other types of devices that need to connect to the internet. Wi-Fi is a convenient and flexible way to access the internet and to connect devices to each other, and it is now an essential part of many people's daily lives.

## 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G
2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G are generations of mobile communication technology that have succeeded each other over the years. Each generation represents a significant advance in the capabilities of mobile communication systems, and each has been designed to meet the increasing demands for data, speed, and connectivity.

2G (second generation) was the first digital cellular technology, and it was introduced in the early 1990s. It was designed to provide voice and basic data services, such as text messaging and simple internet access. 2G technology is based on circuit-switched communication, which means that a dedicated connection is established between two phones for the duration of a call.

3G (third generation) was introduced in the early 2000s and was designed to provide higher data rates and more advanced services, such as video calling and mobile internet access. 3G technology is based on packet-switched communication, which allows data to be transmitted in small packets over the internet.

4G (fourth generation) was introduced in the late 2000s and is designed to provide even higher data rates and more advanced services, such as high-definition video and mobile broadband. 4G technology is based on Internet Protocol (IP) and is designed to be all-IP, which means that all communication is transmitted over the internet using IP packets.

5G (fifth generation) is the latest generation of mobile communication technology, and it is currently being rolled out in many parts of the world. 5G is designed to provide ultra-high data rates and low latency, which makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, such as virtual reality, connected cars, and the Internet of Things (IoT). 5G technology is based on new radio frequency bands and new technologies, such as massive MIMO and beamforming, which allow it to provide higher data rates and better coverage than previous generations.

## Radio communication 
Radio communication is a type of communication that uses radio waves to transmit and receive messages. Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation that travels through the air at the speed of light. Radio communication is used for a wide range of applications, including broadcasting, two-way radio communication, and wireless networking.

Radio communication systems consist of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter converts a message, such as a voice or a data signal, into a radio frequency (RF) signal, which is then transmitted through the air using an antenna. The receiver receives the RF signal and converts it back into the original message using another antenna.

Radio communication has many advantages over other types of communication, such as its ability to transmit over long distances, its ability to penetrate obstacles, and its ability to work in a variety of environments. It is used in a wide range of applications, including broadcasting, two-way radio communication, cellular communication, and wireless networking. Radio communication is an essential part of modern life and is used in many aspects of daily life, including communication, entertainment, and navigation.

## Microwave systems
Microwave systems are communication systems that use microwaves, which are radio waves with frequencies that are higher than those used in traditional radio communication systems. Microwaves are located in the electromagnetic spectrum between infrared radiation and visible light, and they have wavelengths that range from about one millimeter to one meter.

Microwave systems are used for a wide range of applications, including point-to-point communication, satellite communication, and wireless networking. They are especially useful for long-distance communication, as they can transmit signals over long distances with relatively low loss. They are also less affected by obstacles and interference than lower frequency radio waves, which makes them suitable for use in urban and other congested areas.

Microwave systems use specialized antennas, called microwave antennas, to transmit and receive microwaves. These antennas are usually small and directional, which allows them to focus the microwaves in a narrow beam. This allows microwave systems to transmit large amounts of data over long distances with relatively low power.

Microwave systems are used in a wide range of applications, including point-to-point communication, satellite communication, and wireless networking. They are also used in radar systems, for cooking food, and for many other purposes.

## Communication Satellite, Radar, Fiber Optics 
A communication satellite is a type of artificial satellite that is used to transmit and receive communication signals from the earth. Communication satellites are placed in orbit around the earth at an altitude of several hundred miles, and they are equipped with antennas that transmit and receive signals over a wide area. Communication satellites are used to provide a variety of communication services, including television, radio, telephone, and internet.

Radar is a type of electromagnetic system that is used to detect the presence, location, and movement of objects. Radar systems transmit electromagnetic waves and listen for reflections, which allow them to detect objects that are beyond the line of sight. Radar is used in a wide range of applications, including aviation, military, and weather forecasting.

Fiber optics is a type of communication technology that uses strands of glass or plastic to transmit data using light. Fiber optic cables are made up of thin strands of glass or plastic, called fibers, which are surrounded by a protective coating. Light signals are transmitted through the fibers using a process called total internal reflection, which allows them to travel over long distances without losing strength. Fiber optic cables are used to transmit data over long distances and are especially useful for high-speed communication. They are used in a wide range of applications, including telecommunications, internet, and cable television.

## Introduction and properties of ISDN
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a digital communication standard that is used to transmit voice, data, and other types of information over traditional telephone networks. ISDN has several key properties that make it an efficient and reliable way to transmit digital information:

- Digital transmission: ISDN uses digital signaling to transmit information, which provides several benefits over analog signaling. Digital transmission is more efficient, as it allows more data to be transmitted in a given amount of time. It is also more resistant to noise and interference, which makes it more reliable.

- High-speed transmission: ISDN is designed to provide high-speed transmission of data and other types of information. It supports data rates of up to 128 kbps, which is much faster than analog modems and allows for the transmission of data-intensive applications, such as video conferencing and high-speed internet access.

- Multiple channels: ISDN uses two separate channels to transmit data and voice information, which allows for the simultaneous transmission of multiple types of information. This makes ISDN an efficient way to transmit both voice and data over the same connection.

- Compatibility: ISDN is compatible with traditional telephone networks, which makes it easy to implement and use.

# UNIT 2
## Information security
Information security, also known as cybersecurity or IT security, is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. The goal of information security is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by applying a risk management framework and giving a set of policies and procedures.

Confidentiality refers to protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure. This includes things like protecting personal information, financial information, and confidential business information.

Integrity refers to the protection of information from unauthorized modification or destruction. This includes things like ensuring data is not tampered with or destroyed, and that any updates to the information are done by authorized personnel.

Availability refers to ensuring that authorized users have access to the information when they need it. This includes things like ensuring that systems are always available and that information is backed up so it can be restored in the event of a disaster.

Information security threats come from a wide range of sources, including hackers, viruses, malware, and natural disasters. To combat these threats, organizations implement security controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and encryption. Additionally, organizations may also use threat intelligence to stay informed about the latest security risks and vulnerabilities.

It is important for organizations to have a thorough understanding of their assets, vulnerabilities, and the potential threats they face. This allows them to implement the appropriate security controls and procedures to protect their information and systems.

## Malicious Programs (Malware) 
Malicious programs, also known as malware, are software programs that are designed to cause harm to a computer system or network. There are several types of malware, including:

- Malicious Programs (Virus) : A virus is a type of malware that attaches itself to a legitimate program and then replicates itself by making copies of itself and spreading to other systems.

- Malicious Programs (Worm) : A worm is a type of malware that can replicate itself without the need for a host program, and can spread to other systems through network vulnerabilities.

- Trojan: A Trojan is a type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program and tricks Malicious Programs (users)  into installing it. Once installed, it can perform a variety of malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive information or giving an attacker control of the infected system.

- Malicious Programs (Ransomware) : Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a user's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key.

- Malicious Programs (Adware) : Adware is a type of malware that displays unwanted ads on a user's computer. It can be bundled with other programs and can be difficult to remove.

- Spyware: Spyware is a type of malware that is used to collect information about a user's browsing habits and other activities.

One of the main ways that malware is spread is through phishing emails, which are emails that are designed to trick users into clicking on a link or opening an attachment that contains malware. Other ways malware can be spread include via drive-by downloads, infected software downloads, and exploits in unpatched software vulnerabilities.

To protect against malware, it is important to keep software updated, use anti-virus and anti-malware software, avoid opening unknown or suspicious email attachments or links, and be cautious when downloading or installing software from the internet.

Regularly backup important data and keep the backup copies offline can be a good practice in case of any successful attack and data loss.

It is important to have a incident response plan for handling the attacks and reporting the incident to the concerned authorities and maintaining the log for the same to help in forensic investigation.

## Cryptography
Cryptography is the practice of securing information by transforming it into a form that is unreadable to anyone without the knowledge of how to reverse the transformation. This transformation is known as encryption, and the process of reversing the transformation is known as decryption.

There are several types of encryption algorithms that can be used, but they generally fall into two main categories: symmetric and asymmetric.

Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. This means that the same key that is used to encrypt the data is also used to decrypt it. Some examples of symmetric encryption algorithms include AES, DES, and Blowfish.

Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key encryption, uses two keys: one for encryption, known as the public key, and one for decryption, known as the private key. Data encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. This allows for secure communications, even when the keys are exchanged over an insecure channel. Some examples of asymmetric encryption algorithms include RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC).

Another cryptographic technique is the use of Hash functions that take in any size of data and gives a fixed size output called Hash. Hash functions are one-way functions i.e data cannot be retrieved from the output, its primary use is for integrity check and data indexing. Example of hash function is SHA-256, SHA-512 etc.

Cryptography is an important element of information security, as it can be used to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure. It can be used to secure communications, protect data at rest and in transit, and ensure the integrity of data. However, it is important to remember that the security of an encryption system is only as strong as the security of the keys used to encrypt and decrypt the data, so it is important to properly protect the keys.

Also, Cryptography algorithm and protocols are constantly evolving, and new cryptographic attack methods are discovered and published frequently, hence there is a need to be keep updating the encryption standards and algorithms used to avoid any future vulnerabilities.

## Digital Signature
A digital signature is an electronic version of a handwritten signature that is used to authenticate the identity of the sender of a message or the signer of a document. Digital signatures use cryptography to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the signed data.

A digital signature works by creating a unique code, called a hash, that is based on the contents of the document or message. The signer then encrypts the hash using their private key, and this encrypted hash is sent along with the document or message as the digital signature. The recipient can then use the signer's public key to decrypt the signature and compare the decrypted signature to a newly calculated hash of the document or message to verify that the document or message has not been tampered with and that it was indeed sent by the signer.

## Firewall
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of security rules. The main purpose of a firewall is to prevent unauthorized access to a private network while allowing authorized communications to pass through.

Firewalls can be implemented in hardware or software, and they can be classified into two main categories: network firewalls and host-based firewalls.

A network firewall is a hardware or software system that is placed at the boundary of a network and controls access to the network by inspecting incoming and outgoing network traffic and comparing it to a set of security rules. Some examples of network firewalls include routers with firewall functionality and standalone firewall appliances.

A host-based firewall is a software system that is installed on a single host and controls access to the host's resources. It is designed to protect a single host from unauthorized access and malware. Most of the modern Operating System come with inbuilt Host-based Firewall.

Firewall rules are generally based on the source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols of the network traffic. Firewalls can also be configured to inspect the content of network traffic and to block traffic that matches certain criteria, such as traffic that contains known malware.

Firewall can be a important element of the overall security structure of an organization, it can block unwanted traffic, malicious attack and also can help in compliance adherence.

## Mobile Commerce
