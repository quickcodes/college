# Networking

If you are in Technical world then Networking is something i highly suggest you to understand deeply. The more you learn computer networks the more benefecial it is. It gives you a core understanding of what is actually happening.

Understanding Computer Networks is really fun. You may heard of cloud computers, cloud applications, cloud bla bla bla etc. So what does cloud mean? Are they are the actual clouds. Definetly not in Technology cloud simply means internet so what cloud computer means is a computer on the internet. It's a basic thing that many of advance tech guy don't know.

Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other.

So in order to communicate our computer with another computer there are two ways.

1. Physical 
2. Logical

#### Physical 
By physical communication what I means is connecting computers with physical stuffs like cables. So they can transfer data or things like that. And because devices are connected physically the speed of communication is much faster than logical. And here device can be anything like camera, keyboard, mouse, display, anything... networking is not only a communication between two computer. Keyboard and cpu also needs to communicate, and so on.

#### Logical 
A logical network communication got done wirelessly and here device are called nodes. There are two types of model by which we can logically communicate. 
1. OSI Model
2. tcp/ip model
